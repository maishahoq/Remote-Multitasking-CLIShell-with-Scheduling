 ### Description
 ***
This remote CLI shell simulates some services of the OS including the current Linux shell features, multi-processing, multi-threading, socket communication, scheduling, etc. The project is divided in four related phases. The solutions require the use of: 

1. process creation
2. inter-process communication using sockets and pipes
3. multiprocessing
4. multithreading
5. scheduling and synchronization

In your project, my teammate and I created a fully functional remote shell including our own time-based scheduler.
